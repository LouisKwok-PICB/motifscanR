# motifscanR

Scan input genomic regions with known DNA motifs

Given a set of input genomic regions, motifscanR scans the sequences to detect the occurrences of known motifs. It can also applies a statistical test on each motif to check whether the motif is significantly over- or under-represented (enriched or depleted) in the input genomic regions compared to another set of control regions.
