Description: Given a set of input genomic regions, motifscanR scans 
     the sequences to detect the occurrences of known motifs. It can 
     also applies a statistical test on each motif to check whether 
     the motif is significantly over- or under-represented (enriched or depleted) 
     in the input genomic regions compared to another set of control regions.
